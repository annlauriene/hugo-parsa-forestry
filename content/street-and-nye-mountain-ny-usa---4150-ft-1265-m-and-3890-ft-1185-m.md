On September 19th 2015, we packed our hiking equipment and went on another trip to the Adirondacks. We left Montreal on Saturday morning at 7:30pm and headed straight to the Adirondack LoJ at Heart lake. On our agenda was Nye and Street Mountain, nr. 45 and nr. 31 on the Adirondack 46er list. The trail is not maintained but can be found easily. We had a Garmin eTrex 20x with us for tracking and checking the trail. We had to park our car near the overflow parking lot 1 mile from the visitor center.<br /><br />At 10:20am we started our hike towards Street mountain. The trail rocky and follows along a river bed. After 9km and 3hrs of hiking, we were on top of Street mountain. The view at the top is not breathtaking as the mountain is covered in trees. After a short 20min decent, we hiked up another 15min to the top of Nye mountain. This was our 18th and 19th peak in the Adirondack mountains, 'only' 27 more peaks to complete the list. The decent was fairly easy and we completed the whole 18.3 km (11.4 miles) hike within 7hrs including roughly 1hr of breaks.<br /><br /><iframe height="480" src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=z9AtqvgI4o0E.kklyPwz8z1vo" width="640"></iframe> <br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HmV4ohBX50U/VgIKW25WOyI/AAAAAAAAXJc/4QuqQIPDNDg/s1600/Street_Nye.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HmV4ohBX50U/VgIKW25WOyI/AAAAAAAAXJc/4QuqQIPDNDg/s640/Street_Nye.png" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-b0yEyEYjXIg/VgIK70HaTqI/AAAAAAAAXJk/RP74TdCL0kg/s1600/P1180588.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-b0yEyEYjXIg/VgIK70HaTqI/AAAAAAAAXJk/RP74TdCL0kg/s640/P1180588.JPG" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WoZWziCo7aU/VgIK7_Qa0_I/AAAAAAAAXJo/GsPeRZqRnvk/s1600/P1180589.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WoZWziCo7aU/VgIK7_Qa0_I/AAAAAAAAXJo/GsPeRZqRnvk/s640/P1180589.JPG" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-m9hifHHCGCA/VgIK-OPRLHI/AAAAAAAAXJ0/Fb0j64CB1XE/s1600/P1180596.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-m9hifHHCGCA/VgIK-OPRLHI/AAAAAAAAXJ0/Fb0j64CB1XE/s640/P1180596.JPG" width="640" /></a></div><span id="goog_1380448993"></span><span id="goog_1380448994"></span><br />Our hike on the next day started in the Keene Valley. Therefore, we drove from the Adk LoJ to Keene Valley to set up our camp by the Roaring Brooke waterfalls. We pitched our tents at like 8pm when it started to rain. Fortunately, the campground is covered with tree which keep you protected a bit. On the second day, we hiked four more 46er peaks, read here.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ihDy8Z_xzfc/VgILheTi6-I/AAAAAAAAXKA/CKnv8GfMIMk/s1600/P1180602.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="426" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ihDy8Z_xzfc/VgILheTi6-I/AAAAAAAAXKA/CKnv8GfMIMk/s640/P1180602.JPG" width="640" /></a></div><br />
