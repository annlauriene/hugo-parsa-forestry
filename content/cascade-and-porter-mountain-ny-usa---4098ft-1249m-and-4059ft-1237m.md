After successfully hiking five 46ers the day before (read here), we decided to hike two more: Cascade and Porter mountain. This is definitely one of the more easy hikes of the 46ers. We parked by the parking lot near the trail head and started our hike at 10:15am. At 12pm we reached the summit of Cascade. The view from there is stunning as you can see the whole great range with <a href="http://peakhunt.blogspot.ca/2015/03/snowshoeing-mount-marcy-ny-usa-5343-ft.html" target="_blank">Mt. Marcy</a>, <a href="http://peakhunt.blogspot.ca/2013/10/algonquin-peak-ny-usa.html" target="_blank">Algonquin</a>, etc. For the first time on a mountain, we had an authentic swiss cheese fondu with white wine, absolutely tasty and amazing. After a 50min cheese break, we were heading to Porter which is on the other side. 25min later, at 1:15pm we reached the top of Porter and a nice view to Cascade, the mountain that we just climbed. At 1:45pm we started our descend back to our car and reached the parking lot at 3:30pm. The total hike is 5.9miles (9.5km) and took us 3hr 55min.
